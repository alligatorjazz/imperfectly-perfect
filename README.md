# Imperfectly Perfect (ip.btw)

A clone of the basic functionality of the [Perfectly Imperfect](https://www.pi.fyi) site. For demonstration purposes only.

Some things to note:
- You can't actually login with your real Perfectly Imperfect account here - make a new (fake) one using the app's signup.
- Some of the dummy posts have links attached. The urls are valid, but the links don't actually go anywhere - they're just for demonstration.
